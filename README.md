## Deployment instructions

- It's required to import an .env file in the root of the project, including the set of links pointing to the source datasets.
Contact Lorenzo Ceccanti via email for obtaining such env file.

- It's required to import an .env file to be included into ./application. The structure of that env file is the following:
<code>FLASK_PORT = your_flask_port
FLASK_ADDRESS = "a_flask_address"
STREAMLIT_PORT = your_streamlit_port</code>

- In order to correctly visualize the graphs, if you are running the notebooks on Visual Studio Code make sure to have installed the <code> Jupyter Notebook Renderers </code> extension by Microsoft.
